export const bio = `<div class="mb-4">
  As a Lead Frontend Developer and advocate for thoughtful,
  human-centered technology, I specialize in building React-based
  codebases from the ground up. Whether optimizing existing codebases, 
  interweaving cross team components, or starting from scratch, I focus on integrating: <b>1) scalable, 2) legible,
  </b> and <b>3) efficiently, maintainabile architecture</b>.
</div>
<div class="mb-4">
  Over the last decade, Iâ€™ve led frontend teams, mentored junior
  developers, and established robust style guides and coding standards
  to ensure consistency and collaboration across frontend projects and
  development teams.
</div>
<div class="mb-4">
  My technical strengths include <b>React, TypeScript, Next.js, Angular,
  Tailwind, and Sass</b> with a particular passion for API-driven
  development, AI ethics, system design, and developer experience. I
  thrive in roles where autonomy, ownership, and cross-functional
  collaboration come together to create meaningful, user-focused
  applications.
</div>
<div class="mb-4">
  In parallel, I bring a unique background in digital marketing,
  artistic development, and healing arts therapy. All experiences that
  deepen my empathy, creativity, and communication in cross-team
  collaboration, AI integration, and technical leadership.
