  As a Lead Frontend Developer and advocate for thoughtful,
  human-centered technology, I specialize in building React-based
  codebases from the ground up. Whether turning ideas into interactive actualities, getting existing codebases to run effortlessly, 
  resolving cross-team disputes, or building a frontend team form scratch, I have a few core tenents.

  <div class="font-bold mb-2">1) What are the pain points? Does this block us or bug us? </div>
  <div class="font-bold mb-2">2) Is there and what is the root?</div>
  <div class="font-bold mb-2">3) Is it more more client-conscious to address it or pivot? Is it more more developer-compassionate to address it or pivot?</div>

  <div class="font-bold mb-2">5) How can we ensure code is scalable and efficient while retaining legible and enjoyable architecture?</div>
  </div>
<div class="mb-4">
  Over the last decade, I’ve led frontend teams, mentored junior
  developers, and established robust style guides and coding standards
  to unify consistency and empower collaboration across frontend projects and
  development teams.
</div>
<div class="mb-4">
  My technical strengths include <b>React, TypeScript, Next.js, Angular,
  Tailwind, and Sass</b> with a particular passion for API-driven
  development, AI ethics, system design, and developer experience. I
  thrive in roles where autonomy, ownership, and cross-functional
  collaboration come together to create meaningful, user-focused
  applications.
</div>
<div class="">
  In parallel, I bring a unique background in digital marketing,
  artistic development, and healing arts therapy. All experiences that
  deepen my empathy, creativity, and communication in cross-team
  collaboration, AI integration, and technical leadership.
