  As a Lead Frontend Developer and advocate for thoughtful,
  human-centered technology, I specialize in building React-based
  codebases from the ground up. Whether turning ideas into interactive actualities, getting existing codebases to run effortlessly, 
  resolving cross-team disputes, or building a frontend team form scratch, I have a few core tenents.

  <div class="font-bold mb-2">1) What are the pain points? Does this block us or bug us? </div>
  <div class="font-bold mb-2">2) Is there and what is the root?</div>
  <div class="font-bold mb-2">3) Is it more more client-conscious to address it or pivot? Is it more more developer-compassionate to address it or pivot?</div>

  <div class="font-bold mb-2">5) How can we ensure code is scalable and efficient while retaining legible and enjoyable architecture?</div>
  </div>
<div class="mb-4">
  Over the last decade, Iâ€™ve led frontend teams, mentored junior
  developers, and established robust style guides and coding standards
  to unify consistency and empower collaboration across frontend projects and
  development teams.
</div>
<div class="mb-4">
  My technical strengths include <b>React, TypeScript, Next.js, Angular,
  Tailwind, and Sass</b> with a particular passion for API-driven
  development, AI ethics, system design, and developer experience. I
  thrive in roles where autonomy, ownership, and cross-functional
  collaboration come together to create meaningful, user-focused
  applications.
</div>
<div class="">
  In parallel, I bring a unique background in digital marketing,
  artistic development, and healing arts therapy. All experiences that
  deepen my empathy, creativity, and communication in cross-team
  collaboration, AI integration, and technical leadership.
